Day Planner gives users the opportunity to add and save their daily tasks from 9 am to 6 pm.

The user is presented with 10 textboxes each having it's own timestamp from 9 am to 5 pm

The user clicks on a textbox, adds the task or event, and can save their daily task corresponding to each time by clicking on the save button.

The tasks that the user adds will stil be there even if the user refreshes. This is accomplished by using the Javascript local storage function.

The program was created using HTML/CSS for the frontend and all the backend logic was made possible using Javascript.

Here are screenshots from the website.
